We can now receive text messages. But we should review the payload specs to make
sure of things. But maybe more importantly (for now), we should learn how to:
1. get the identity of the message sender from the sender id.
2. learn to reply.

I've finally started implementing this fb_messenger endpoint. The thing is i foresee
some difficulties in testing it: I'll either have to learn __cloudflare tunnels__ or deploy 
this already to an aws ec2 instance. The payoff is just too long or expensive (deploying to AWS
also requires getting the domain name and ssl cert running.). Maybe i can 
first take a look at the fb messenger quick start to see how 
to get something running quickly?
